The target of this repo is to lead js beginner to go deep into memory view and get deeper understanding of what and why js is actually doing.
The author is not a js programmer but a C and C# programmer who worked in Game industry. For some interesting reason, need to teach JS to someone ^_^, so keep the tutorial material here for otherbody who just begin learning JS.
To launch it, you can simply open VSCode, and select one of scripts in test folder, and it should work.
