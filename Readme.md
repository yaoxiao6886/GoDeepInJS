**目标**
    本仓库的目的是为了让js的初学者可以对js的机制有更深入的了解, 比如内存分布, 函数执行原理等.

    作者并不是一个JS的开发者^_^, 我是一个专注于游戏开发的C#和C领域的程序, 对引擎和底层有研究兴趣. 因为一些原因需要教授JS, 编制了这套练习题以供练习

    为了开始答题, 你需要安装VSCode, 然后开始.


**Target**
    The target of this repo is to lead js beginner to go deep into memory view and get deeper understanding of what and why js is actually doing.

    The author is not a js programmer but a C and C# programmer who worked in Game industry. For some interesting reason, need to teach JS to someone ^_^, so keep the tutorial material here for otherbody who just begin learning JS.

    To launch it, you can simply open VSCode, and select one of scripts in test folder, and it should work.
